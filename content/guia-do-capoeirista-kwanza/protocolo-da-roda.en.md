## Rhythms and Clapping Patterns

In the group, each main rhythm has a specific clapping pattern. Mestre Jaguara preserves the tradition passed down to him and, for this reason, we maintain this way of playing.

Below is the clapping style corresponding to each rhythm:

  - **São Bento Pequeno de Angola**: accompanied by two claps.
  - **São Bento Grande de Angola**: accompanied by four claps.
  - **São Bento Grande da Regional**: accompanied by three claps.
  - **Benguela**: accompanied by three claps.
