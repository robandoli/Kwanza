sobre_projeto:
  titulo: "About the Project"
  conteudo: |
    Vem Aprender is a cultural project dedicated to Samba de Roda from the Recôncavo Baiano, an Afro-Brazilian manifestation of ancestral, community, and educational character. The project acts as a space for preservation, transmission, and continuity of traditional knowledge, understanding samba de roda as a living practice, collectively built and deeply connected to the history of Black people in Brazil.

    Through singing, musicality, body movement, and the roda experience, Vem Aprender develops continuous formative actions that respect the foundations of tradition, value ancestry, and strengthen cultural memory. Its activities include regular classes, experiences, workshops, and presentations, promoting access to traditional knowledge in a responsible, accessible manner committed to cultural preservation.

    Embedded in the contemporary social context, the project reaffirms samba de roda as an expression of identity, education, and cultural resistance, contributing to confronting historical erasure and prejudice against Afro-Brazilian cultural manifestations.
