sobre_projeto:
  titulo: "About the Project"
  conteudo: |
    Come Learn is a cultural project dedicated to Samba de Roda from the Recôncavo region of Bahia, an Afro-Brazilian manifestation of ancestral, communal, and educational character. The project serves as a space for preservation, transmission, and continuity of traditional knowledge, understanding samba de roda as a living practice, collectively constructed and deeply connected to the history of Black people in Brazil.

    Through singing, musical expression, movement, and the shared circle experience, Come Learn develops ongoing educational actions that respect traditional foundations, value ancestry, and strengthen cultural memory. Its activities include regular classes, immersive experiences, workshops, and performances, promoting responsible and accessible access to traditional knowledge while remaining committed to cultural preservation.

    Within the contemporary social context, the project reaffirms samba de roda as an expression of identity, education, and cultural resistance, contributing to confronting historical erasure and prejudice against Afro-Brazilian cultural manifestations.
