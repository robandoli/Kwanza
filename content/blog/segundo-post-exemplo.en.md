Since its origin, capoeira has always been more than a physical practice. It carries within itself the power to transform lives, form people, and strengthen communities.

## Education Through Capoeira

At Grupo Kwanza, capoeira is understood as an **integral educational practice**. We teach not only movement techniques, but values such as:

- Respect for others
- Discipline and commitment
- Collective responsibility
- Valorization of Afro-Brazilian culture

## Community Impact

Our centers in different cities and countries act as spaces of welcome, learning, and belonging. Capoeira offers children, youth, and adults a tool for self-knowledge, cultural expression, and identity construction.

## Training People

More than training capoeiristas, Grupo Kwanza trains people aware of their role in society, capable of contributing positively to their communities and preserving the cultural tradition entrusted to them.
