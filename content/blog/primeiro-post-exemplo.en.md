The way we tie our cord also communicates discipline. It may seem like a small detail, but a properly tied knot reflects organization, respect for tradition, and care in personal presentation inside the roda.

Among the different tying methods, the most well-known is the **Boca de Lobo** knot. It is firm, secure, and suitable for daily practice.

## Step-by-Step: Boca de Lobo Knot

The execution is simple once you understand the correct sequence.

**1. Position the cord around your waist**  
Place the cord around your waist, leaving both ends at similar length.

**2. Cross the ends in front of your body**  
Form an “X” at the front of your waist.

**3. Pass underneath and bring it forward**  
The end that is on top should pass underneath the other and return to the front.  
The movement must be done in front — not behind the body.

**4. Create the loop**  
Hold firmly and form a small opening with the cord.

**5. Pass the other end through and over**  
Insert the end into the opening created and bring it over, shaping the knot.

**6. Adjust and tighten**  
Pull both ends until the knot is centered and secure.

## Attention to Detail

Common mistakes include:

- Crossing the cord behind the body.  
- Leaving the knot loose.  
- Not centering the knot at the front.

In capoeira, details build posture. An attentive capoeirista demonstrates discipline and respect for the practice.
