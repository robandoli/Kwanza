description: "Lineage, hierarchy, and the people who build Grupo Kwanza."

historia_grupo: |

  **Grupo Kwanza** was born from a trajectory built over decades of experience
  in capoeira, marked by a commitment to its **cultural, educational, and
  human** foundations.

  Its lineage develops from coexistence and learning alongside great groups and
  important masters of Brazilian capoeira, in a journey that has always valued
  **tradition, hierarchy, and responsibility** in the formation of people. On this path,
  capoeira was understood not only as a physical practice, but as **cultural
  expression and philosophy of life**.

  The group was officially founded on **April 6, 2014**, as the result of a
  process of maturation and autonomy. Its creation represented the need to
  build a space where knowledge, musicality, and formative work would be
  valued integrally.

  Since then, Grupo Kwanza acts as a space for **continuous formation**, preserving
  respect for ancestry and the social role of capoeira.

historia_mestre: |
  **Grupo Kwanza** is led by Paulo Ricardo de Souza, **Mestre Jaguara**,
  a capoeira master with over five decades of dedication to the art.
  His first contact with capoeira occurred in 1975, in Olinda–PE, when
  the strength of the game and musicality awakened a path marked by
  discipline and the constant search for learning.

  Throughout his formation, he built his foundation with renowned masters such as
  **Marinheiro, Russo, Ditinho, and Nestor**, in addition to receiving fundamental
  influences from Mestre Zambi and Mestre Burguês.
  His trajectory also counted on the mentorship and friendship of Mestre Leopoldina.
  In Capoeira Angola, he was a **disciple of Mestre Gato Preto**, his main
  reference in that style.
  He also lived alongside Mestres Ananias and Joel, who, at different moments,
  contributed with support and counsel on his journey.

  Recognition as a master occurred on July 30, 1991.
  On that occasion, he took over the group Jogo de Guerreiro, from Mestre Ditinho.
  Driven by the desire to deepen his foundations, he sought the knowledge of
  **Mestre Zambi (Grupo Filhos de Zambi)**, under whose guidance he strengthened ties
  that led him to become his disciple.
  For Mestre Jaguara, the title of master represents the profound responsibility
  of forming people and preserving values.

  Capoeira is understood as a way of living — a practice that traverses
  the body, culture, and daily life.
  His philosophy is based on respect for others, honesty, and the
  valorization of human relationships.
